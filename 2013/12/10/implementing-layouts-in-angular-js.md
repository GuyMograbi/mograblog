I see a lot of people having hard time with this in angular due to ng-view which is confusing. The goal - to have a reusable page layout The tools - wrong way - ng-include you might see variations of things like or god forbid each page should copy/paste the includes.. why the hack would I want to copy paste if I have angularjs? my way - layout directive with transclude problem - scope issues like in ng-repeat - just use objects on the scope.
