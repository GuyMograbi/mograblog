  

So I finally got a laptop from work. Thank god. Recommended to everyone. I can finally have dinner with my family at normal hours and keep working after everyone are asleep.

And as usual - I had a lot of programs to install, and a lot of customization.

One of the items on my todo list is to disable the Graphics Hot Keys. The key combination is

<pre>ctrl+alt+arrow</pre>

when the arrow can be up/down/left/right - and that decides the orientation of the screen.

As an Intellij user I use this combination a lot to navigate.  
You'd usually right-click on your desktop and click to disable the hot-keys. But it didn't work this time!  
The solution was not simple at all! It seems that on my laptop there was an application called "Lenovo Reading Optimizer".  
The idea was that when you read, you probably want to change the display orientation in your laptop.  
I have to say - it is a really good idea and I will probably use it once I get home today - but for now I had to disable the hot-keys.  
I uninstalled the "Reading Optimizer" and it resolved the issue.
