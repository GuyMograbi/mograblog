I enabled my apache with SSL recently.. Had to change many files.  
And once I managed to get SSL working, I noticed my PHP configuration was messed up..  

I had no idea what to do.  
My PHP files were shown as Plain text.  

I searched and searched on the web, when suddenly I figured out the problem without finding it online.. which is exactly why I maintain this blog.  

The solution is SO SIMPLE it's simply annoying..  

Check your conf/mime.types file and make sure you see the lines  

<pre>application/x-httpd-php php  
application/x-httpd-php-source phps  
</pre>

That solved the problem to me..  
Please comment me if it didn't help you - I would love to solve your problems as well.  
Enjoy.
