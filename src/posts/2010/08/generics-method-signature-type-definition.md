On my [previous post](http://mograblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/generics-did-you-know.html) I introduce some advanced things about generics, when I discovered I forgot a very important feature.  

As specified before, you can declare a generic type on a method declaration.  

```
public <T> T newInstance(Class <T>clzz, String name) throws IllegalAccessException, InstantiationException
{
   return (T) Spring.getBean( "myBean" );
}
```

disregarding for a moment the ugly cast. (in this case you better use Class#cast function).  
as you can see, I don't really need "clzz" there. I use it only to define T.  
However you can also do without it"Class <t>clzz".  

You can also write the following function definition  

```
public <T> T newInstance(String name) throws IllegalAccessException, InstantiationException
{
   return (T) Spring.getBean( "myBean" );
}
```

and call it like this  

```
public void test() throws InstantiationException, IllegalAccessException
{
    String str = this.<String>newInstance( "guy" );
}
```

In this specific case, you don't really need to specify <t>since it is "inferred" and so the compiler will tell you  

```
Explicit type arguments can be inferred
```

however when you get to inheritance and scenarios which are more complex than this one, it will no longer be inferred.  

NOTE : This was tested on JDK 1.6\. I am unsure about 1.5 compatibility.  

# Compiler Support Issue

Some of you might try this and get the following message :  

```
type parameters of <T> T cannot be determined; no unique maximal instance exists for type variable T with upper bounds, java.lang.Object
```

Intellij users will run into this the fastest..  

It seems this is compiler dependend.  

Java has several compilers :  

*   [Javac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javac)  
*   [Jikes](http://jikes.sourceforge.net/)
*   Eclipse

probably more, but these are the compilers intellij supports.  
Each with its own advantages.  

However - it seems that when working on Intellij, you get JavaC as default compiler, but that compiler cannot handle the syntax shown above!! - you can reproduce the problem from command line.  

To resolve this, all you need to do is tell intellij to use Eclipse Compiler.  
Settings ==> Compiler ==> Java Compiler ==> Use compiler : Eclipse  

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J3A8WqpdCX0/TF_0ipfILkI/AAAAAAAAAmA/d6OeFx_9PY8/s320/eclipse_compiler_setting.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J3A8WqpdCX0/TF_0ipfILkI/AAAAAAAAAmA/d6OeFx_9PY8/s1600/eclipse_compiler_setting.png)</div>

And the error will go away.  
HOWEVER - NOTE - Once you use the eclipse compiler, you should insert the target/source attributes to command line :  
like this :  

```
-target 1.6 -source 1.6
```

or whatever version you use.  

There's also [a comment in a "YouTrack" thread by intellij](http://youtrack.jetbrains.net/issue/IDEA-52447#comment=27-139287) that explains this while suggesting a different solution.  

# Configuring Eclipse Compiler in a Maven Project

If you are compiling with Maven, you should define the eclipse compiler as such  

```
<plugin>
    <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <compilerId>eclipse </compilerId>
        <source>1.6</source>
        <target>1.6</target>

    </configuration>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.codehaus.plexus</groupId>
            <artifactId>plexus-compiler-eclipse</artifactId>
            <version>1.8</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>
```
