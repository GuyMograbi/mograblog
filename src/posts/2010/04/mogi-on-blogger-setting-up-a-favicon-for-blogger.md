Hey, in order to see this thing at work - you should see this article through blogger. If you are already here look at the favicon (tab/address bar) - and you should see other icon than blogger. You should see my site's favicon or some variation of it.  

I won't explain how to do it here, since a lot of places already do that..  
I used [this article](http://hapiblogging.blogspot.com/2009/01/how-to-change-favicon-in-blogger-in-xml.html)
