As I was writing ["Steps"](http://projectmanager.mograbi.co.il/) I ran into some very helpful information about Rails. So I thought to share.  

# Aptana RadRails

[![](http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/aptana_ide.gif)](http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/aptana_ide.gif)Basically, you don't need an IDE to help you program Ruby. It's a very simple language to handle with a Notepad. However, IDEs are not just a language helper, and while using Rails, I found it very helpful to use [ Aptana - RadRails](http://aptana.com/products/studio3)  

It helps me find definition and usage of functions.  
It helps me refactor (even though I don't do much.. when I do, it is helpful).  
It helps me open a file quickly, and mark when I have a definite error.  

And of course.. debug...  

It has a lot of cool features, and I just specified a few. If you decide to try it, you should check out the rake support they have as well.  

Now, if your IDE already does all these things, then you don't really need it, however it is a really cool tool for beginners since it is based on Eclipse, so it introduces a familiar Look & Feel.

Books and Articles, Forums and Tutorials cannot help you as much as [Ryan Bates](http://railscasts.com/) can.  
You simply don't know until you try.  

Not a post goes by without teaching you something new, or something old but in a different way.  

And its not just the content of the posts, but everything is all so organized. Each post has links to older posts that is somehow related to it and the entire source. So you don't have to work hard at all to get when you need.  

Ryan, thank you.
