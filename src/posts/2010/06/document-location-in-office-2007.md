A very helpful customization in Office is the "Document Location".  
What it does is simply place a text-field with the full path of the file..  

This way, you have an immediate copy-paste of the file location.  
I don't know about you, but as a developer I use it a lot.  

This is how it looks like  

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J3A8WqpdCX0/TBXenSl4SsI/AAAAAAAAAiM/J-zMWcuge3Q/s320/document_path.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J3A8WqpdCX0/TBXenSl4SsI/AAAAAAAAAiM/J-zMWcuge3Q/s1600/document_path.jpg)</div>

See how to get it after the jump

For example in WORD  
*   Go to the Office Icon on top left  
*   Go to Word Options  
*   Click Customize  
*   Choose "all commands"  
*   Scroll down and double click on Document Location  
*   Close everything and look at the top left of the window - you should see the same image as embedded above  

Enjoy.
