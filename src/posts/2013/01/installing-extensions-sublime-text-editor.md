# Installing Extensions Sublime Text Editor

I recommend Sublime Text Editor.  
It has some really nice and strong features, and it has a lot of extensions.  
Extensions in Sublime is called a "package" I think... but I will call it "extension".  
You'll just need to cope with that.  

I found a lot of extensions useful, but one stood out - [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control "Sublime Package Control")  
This extension helps you install more extensions.  
It has a nice integration with github and some more cool features  

If you are looking for a command in Sublime, all you have to do it press <span class="kbd">ctrl+shift+p</span>.  
The "Package Control" extension adds the command "Package Control: Install Package".  
Once you click it, you get a nice menu to all the extensions the Package Control can install for you.
