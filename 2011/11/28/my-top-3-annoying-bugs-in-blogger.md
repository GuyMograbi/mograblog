Over the time I wrote about some annoying bugs in blogger.  
I have to say, even though there are annoying bugs, I still love this product, and I advice everyone to use it.  
Nevertheless, it would be nice to have some issues finally resolved.  
Who cares about templates when the simple blogging feature just doesn't work properly?  

## Redirect

By the time of writing this, I used a custom domain "blog.mograbi.info" after playing around with blogspot at "[mograblog.blogspot.com](http://mograblog.blogspot.com/)"  
Custom domain means that you simply use a different URL to reach to the same page.  
The server - which contains EVERYTHING is the same server, but the NAME simply changes.  
It is as if I would change my personal name from Guy to Gil.  
This doesn't make me a dangerous person with different behavior.  
And when people will still call me Guy, I will notify them about the change, but I will also automatically continue the conversation.  

<pre>  
"Say Guy, do you want to see a movie?"  

"It is Gil, and yes.. I heard it was quite good".  

   </pre>

However, blogger thinks otherwise.  
Using the custom domain will not automatically redirect people to your blog, they will have to actively click "ok", but only after they read how dangerous your blog is.  

<div class="alert">25 SEP 2013  
This still annoys me years later. I just modified my domain from blog.mograbi.info to www.mograblog.com and my site was down for a **day**!.  
Why? Because it took google some time to process it. No way to get around it. Funny how all other DNS servers take 1 hour and google takes a day..</div>

I don't know what I about you, but for me, if I see such a page, I simply walk away.  
And the truth is that my blog IS hosted on blogger, and can be scanned - don't know if it actually is scanned.  
Moreover, the correct behavior should be to return a permanent redirect on everything with "mograblog.blogspot.com" on it to "blog.mograbi.info".  
This way it should not appear in the results - and simply vanish as time pass by.  

## Linking To A Post

This is simply a missing feature.  
Every wiki in the world has this feature, but google's blogger does not.  
First of all - finding the post, is tiresome.  
Adding to that - once I changed my custom domain, I am actually bringing people to a warning page about my blog. how absurd.  
The correct way to implement this feature is by giving a UUID to each post and linking to it.  
This UUID should appear in "share this" widgets, and such a widget should appear in the blogger editor!  
Linking to another post is a crucial element in blogging.  
Also - UUIDs should be available for every link provided by blogger. The archive, labels and what not.  

## Adding stuff

### changing the template

For those of us who understand, and want to write a professional blog on blogger, it simply seems impossible.  
All tutorials of "how to" start the same. Open your settings on the template and edit it. Ignore warning etc..  
Do you know how many times I crashed things because I forgot some closing tag.  
This is simply unsafe and not nice.  
Blogger should provide some proper way to add JS functionalities.  
It also seems to me blogger should add an easy to use professional blog add-ons that will automatically add JQuery, SyntaxHighlight and more. (see more below about this)

### Writing Code

As a developer I would sometimes want to display some code on his blog.  
However, the blogger editor denies that.  
Instead you have to switch to HTML and start editing it.  
But the HTML created by the "Compose" mode is so messy!  
So when I write a professional blog I prefer to work on HTML. Kind of missing the "Compose" idea.  
I think the proper way to handle this, is by mini-customizing the template.  
I want to be able to define class names in CSS on the blog, and then adding them on DIVs or SPANs when I compose.  
This way I can automatically specify `'name="code"'` and `'class="javascript"` and have syntax highlight without hurting my eyes on the horrific HTML produced.  

### Headers

Did you notice there's no proper way to define headers in the "Compose" mode?  
Hack, even the oldest Office version had it.. what's the problem?  
I know there's no technical problem as I wrote a WYSIWYG editor myself and it had header support, and it was very easy to add.  
The Header tag is crucial in many ways - especially CSS and plugins.  
I would really like to add a plugin that automatically adds anchors to my page, but blogger's Compose mode simply denies me of that capability  

### Where are my comments? - added on 25th September 2013

Google recently started integrating Google+ and blogger.  
Which is a great thing, this is why I chose blogger to begin with..  
But! all of a sudden, I don't get notified when users write comments. - and yes I've went through the help guides and checked all my settings everywhere...  
No notifications..  
Not to mention that "if you change the domain, you lose all existing comments"... !!!! WHAT??!?!?!?!  
And oh - yes, sometimes google+ tell me I cannot reply on a comment.. seems to me google+ is not the correct platform for comments as it does not support all the features.
