<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">We all know the well familiar "App wants to use your location" from Apple's devices such as iPod and iPhone and such..  

Today, I noticed the same from Chrome browser.  

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GP5fTxxS5uo/TjgXptuf4qI/AAAAAAAAA9o/963P15Anblk/s320/chrome_location.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GP5fTxxS5uo/TjgXptuf4qI/AAAAAAAAA9o/963P15Anblk/s1600/chrome_location.png)</div>

Weird..  
It seems a new feature is available for geo tagging.  

I must also comment on the new Blogger layout. Amazing!  
I especially liked the editing view for a post.  
You should really try it out.  

What I don't understand, is the "upload image" dialogs..  
When I edit the HTML directly, I get the old style.  
But when I compose, I get the new cool dialog (which allows you to add multiple pictures by the way...).

Without a doubt.. Blogger is on the right track.  
When my sister thought about which blog engine she should use, I recommended Blogger.  
Glad to see it is backed up with actions.Â </div>
