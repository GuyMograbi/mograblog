Google just released a new translate bar with a cool feature where you can pause with the mouse on a word, and it will be translated.. you don't need to mark the word or anything like that.  
You can [read all about it](http://translate.google.com/translate_tools) - just scroll down a bit.  

So naturally, I went to install it using my chrome browser, only to discover it requires Firefox!

A Blooper?  
I don't know..  

Maybe Google thinks their Chrome Translation bar is enough.. maybe I just need to upgrade my chrome to get this toolbar built in or something.  
In any case this is funny.

# Only Google Can

In an older post I wrote about [My thoughts about Google Translate](http://mograblog.blogspot.com/2010/06/googles-translator.html) and the power it holds.  

No one other than Google can dispatch such a toolbar **for free** as a **by the way** kind of manner. "By the way.. there's also a toolbar.." .  

So far only chrome automatically offered to translate pages, however Google got this right - it doesn't really matter which browser you use, as long as you get a good translation experience.  
So now.. I guess, we have it in FF as well.  

# Blogger Translation Widget

Weird enough, the context in which I heard about this toolbar was Blogger..  

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J3A8WqpdCX0/TGEIuIGvlGI/AAAAAAAAAmU/u-XTrgwJxbY/s320/translate_blog.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_J3A8WqpdCX0/TGEIuIGvlGI/AAAAAAAAAmU/u-XTrgwJxbY/s1600/translate_blog.png)</div>

However, as you've probably seen in the link about, this is not a blogger gadget, but a template modification..  
How weird is that???  

Searching for such a gadget, I couldn't find one.. Weird again!  

How hard can that be?  
Yours truly will try to embark on a mission to write this gadget, following [my own blog on writing a blogger gadget](http://mograblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/my-first-blogger-gadget-widget.html) from last time.
