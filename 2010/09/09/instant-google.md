# Why ?

Well it seems a query wastes about 25 seconds on average.  
*   9 seconds to type the query  
*   1 second for Google server to dispatch the results and render them on screen  
*   15 seconds to choose the result we want  

Google keeps trying to make our search faster according to their slogan : "never underestimate fast".  

# 1 second on result fetch and render

Google made this faster with Google Chrome that renders the results very fast, and making their search algorithm better and faster.  

# 9 + 15 second to type and choose

This is the main bottleneck. Google Instant is here to resolve that problem.  
The results appear as you type in.. But wait a minute!  
If I type "w" - it won't search for "w", but instead - Google will use their predictions engine, and they will predict what I want to query about (for "w" this is "weather"),and it will search that(!) and not what is currently typed in.  

The prediction mechanism is here for quite a while now - but up until now the prediction would simply show up in the drop box.  
Lets break it down and have a closer look.  

### The three mechanisms working in Google Instant

*   Instant Results  

The results appear as you type in.Type "w" and get results.  

*   Predictions  

The best search for this feature is the one you don't really remember. For example - a book that you can't really remember its title.  
In the launch event they take "the girl with the dragon tattoo" , and they type "girl dragon" and Google predicted they want results for "the girl with the dragon tattoo".  

*   Scroll to Search  

Lets say we are searching for something that has multiple meanings - we know we will get those different meanings in the drop box, that I can select by pressing the "down/up" keys.  
Once I click those keys - Google Instant will do the search for the currently selected option.  
For example if I search "greek", the drop down will give me the following options :  
*   greek  
*   greek gods  
*   greek alphabet  
*   greek myhtology  
*   greek names  

Lets say I wanted "greek mythology" - I can simply press down 4 times and I will see results without pressing "Enter".  

### what the launch event won't tell you

For some reason, other main features were not mentioned or were not given the correct spotlight.  

*   Spell correction  

The predictions above include "spelling correction". try typing "gurl dregon" and you will see the result for "girl dragon" which is predicted to "the girl with the dragon tattoo".  

*   Key shortcuts  

**<u>Tab for auto-complete</u>**  
As you type in the query - the prediction will try to auto-complete the query. If the auto-complete is correct, you can simply type "Tab" and move on to the next word in the query.  
Try typing "addam" - and you will get a prediction for "addams family", so press "Tab" and then space and add "mu" - this will auto-complete to "musical".  
With 7 key-strokes you searched for "addams family musical".  

# Support

The launch event specifies that "instant" will be supported in browsers : Chrome, FF, Safari, IE8 over the next few months.  
and countries : U.S., U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Spain and Russia - for all users that are signed in.  

Google instant is not available on mobile phones, but it will be soon according to the launch.  

The classic Google Support is still supported. Google Instant simply tries to make your search faster, but if you prefer to, you can simply ignore it or even switch it off.  

**Bandwidth support** - It seems that Google Instant auto detects your bandwidth, and if your bandwidth is low - Google Instant will not work.  
This means - if you're in a cafe with a good internet connection, you'll have "instant", but if then you go to another place with a worse connection, it will be disabled. If you go back to the cafe, you'll have "instant" again.  

# Saving time

Google estimates that each user will save 2-5 seconds per query - which means that overall, summing over all users (over 1 billion each week), you will save 11 hours every second.  
That is an amazing result.  

# Q&A

You can send question to Google on search2010@gmail.com  

# Concerns

Since Google has "search history" and "impressions" support for search statistics, some concerns were raised in the launch to as how this will affects those statistics.  
If you did not get it yet - every key stroke you perform will, technically, be a search. So if you type a 10 letter word (without using auto-complete) you, theoretically, made 10 searches. Will those search phrases be included in your history? and what about impressions - that affect your benefit from AdSense.  

Google's answer to this was that in Instant they have a 3 seconds delay requirement in order to count that search as impression and history. This means - if you typed a search phrase without "enter" and you paused for 3 seconds - that search will be in your "history" and added to Google's impressions statistics.  
This is best put in the article [How Instant New Rule Makes a Sneeze into an Impression](http://www.fastcompany.com/1687976/google-instant-impressions-3-seconds-sneeze)  

A lot of concerns were raised to SEO and page ranking.. even though their rules are the same, the behavior of the user is different - so the concern is legitimate.  
However - Google does not seem to be concerned about that at all, and someone even suggested that the results for all of the above will be better - since the search is more accurate and since there will be more searches, we will see an increase on all statistics.  

# Conclusion

It seems that Google Instant is an empty shell that simply binds some powerful features made by Google over the years - where the most powerful so far is "prediction".  
Indeed, prediction's effect is increased, maybe to a maximum, when Instant is activated.  

Technologically speaking, Instant is just Ajax.. so there's nothing to be proud of that.. However the power and algorithm running behind each key-stroke is pretty mesmerizing.  

I also think Google is right. Instant will benefit our experience, and will become a "must" on every search engine.  

# Funnies

What made me laugh during the launch was the result "facebook" that appeared each time they clicked "f".  

Another thing was the question about "black list for words" - which refers to child protection. (since we don't want dirty results appearing as our children type).  
The question was raised by someone named "slutskin" - and her name would simply no appear on "Instant".
