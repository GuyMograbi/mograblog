[Last time](http://mograblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/first-experience-with-bitly-and-google.html) I wrote how I would like "Google Analytics" built into blogger..  

Amazingly, a day or two afterward, it appeared!  
Of course it is a coincidence, but what a weird one he?  

 It seems [Google announced it a](http://bloggerindraft.blogspot.com/2010/07/introducing-blogger-stats.html)ctually 2 days before I wrote the post, but it appeared a bit later.   
For those of you who are not using "draft" version of blogger, you should, it is stable now, and starts to offer some cool things.  

However, I feel a lot of things are still missing. My number 1 on the list is the ability to link to an older post easily. I mean - come on.. it's not that hard a feature anyways..  

So the new "Stats" tab that shows you the traffic in your blog was just what I needed, and its getting quite a buzz. I have to admit, I didn't think anyone was reading this blog, and it seems I get a low number of hits per day. And even though it is low, it motivates me.  

Naturally, I decided to compare this to other people. I got conflicting answers.  
[In this blog,](http://www.blogcatalog.com/discuss/entry/how-many-hits-a-day-on-your-blog) people commented they have hundreds and thousands of entries and unique visitors. (many unique visitors means you're not the only one reading your blog). Moreover, note their blog's age - two weeks, two months.. Mograblog exists for almost a year now.  
Please comment here as well, on how many hits you get .  

However [this article](http://hubpages.com/hub/Easy-Ways-to-Increase-Traffic-to-your-Website) tells just the opposite, and is probably more reliable.  
And then you get those annoying photos showing many hits :

There are many things you should consider while comparing yourself to others, and while monitoring your own blog.  

*   If you read your own blog, "stats" will count it as a hit. So you are better of staying in "edit" mode or count your own entries in order to calculate the "real" hit count. 
*   Human or Crawler? It is important to know if the reader is a machine or human. However, I couldn't tell if "stats" filters out the automated visitors while I compared it to my Google Analytics results. - Google Analytics works with JavaScript, so you can assume the data is from Human visits, but Blogger's Stats might gather in such a way it accidentally picks up non-human traffic as well. In order to get a better understanding, I try to look at the "traffic source". This way I can 

*   Filter myself out - because all hits from "draft" or "blogger" are probably me. 
*   Make sure the reader was human - if you see a google search phrase in the source you can be sure its human. 
*   Know what your readers are looking for. - I tried doing that with the survey (right top), but as you can see it didn't buzz enough. 

<span style="font-size: x-large;">Going over peoples' searches</span>  
<span style="font-size: x-large;"><span style="font-size: small;">As </span></span>I was going over the sources, I was surprised to find out that they get me as "sole result" in Google.  
Just so you'd get the idea here are two queries for example :  

*   [http://www.google.de/search?hl=de&q=%22uninitialized+constant+Rails%3A%3AInitializer%3A%3AExceptionNotifier%22&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=](http://www.google.de/search?hl=de&q=%22uninitialized+constant+Rails%3A%3AInitializer%3A%3AExceptionNotifier%22&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=)
*   [http://www.google.de/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=HTTP%3A+canonicalising+URL+%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2Fhudson%2F&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=](http://www.google.de/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=HTTP%3A+canonicalising+URL+%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2Fhudson%2F&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=)

Note I pasted the search URL and not keywords so I won't mess up this searches in the future.  
Finding out I am the sole result makes me the happiest blogger on earth - this is exactly why I am writing this blog.  

The main thing I learned from this is most readers are searching technical information - meaning this post will probably not get a lot of hits, of well..  
I am glad to announce that since I found this out, I started gathering a lot more technical stuff, and populating my [wiki](http://wiki.mograbi.co.il/). So hopefully soon you will get a lot more unique technical stuff.  

<span style="font-size: x-large;">Comments<span style="font-size: small;"> </span></span>  
<span style="font-size: x-large;"><span style="font-size: small;">Another source of feedback is the comments. It seems blogger can notify your email when a comment was submitted. Have you ever asked yourself "where can I see comments in blogger?" . As I was searching I couldn't find the answer. </span></span>  
<span style="font-size: x-large;"><span style="font-size: small;">Blogger! where are my comments? </span> </span>it seems there's not single view to show all my comments.  
Yet another feature that I am missing - and yet again, not a hard one..   
I strongly recommend you enable email notification for comments.  
It's a bit confusing because blogger does this great buzz about "Comment Moderation" that when you arrive to "Settings/Comments" and you see "moderation" - you are convinced that the only feature available is moderation..  

I don't want moderation - I want comments to appear right away. I trust my few readers.. ( <3)  
It seems that below everything, you have an "email notification" for comments. Just scroll down the settings/comments windows and you will see it - then just fill in your email.  
Strange!! I would have expected this feature to be enabled by default, or at least have a yellow/red status bar saying  
"This is important - you don't have comments email notifications" - with a link and everything.  

While Google marches on writing the amazing blogger designer, and Stats, for some odd reason these really important and really easy todo (tech joke) features are getting left unnoticed.
