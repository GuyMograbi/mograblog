Google is doing a great job with the next version of Blogger.  
I keep advising you to upgrade.. you should!  

For developers, it's also a beautiful example of how to develop in an agile way, while keeping the application stable enough for usage.  

However, as it always happens, there are bugs.  
Today I started wondering if there's a bug reporting system for blogger?  

It seems there's a forum. So I decided to try and use it.

However, I doubt this forum is an official bug reporting system.

The bug I found (July 24th 2010) if when I try to label a bunch of posts all together using the "label actions" on "edit posts" page.  
I have about 60 posts. So in order to label post #45 I have to go to "Older" pages.  
So I reach page for posts 40-45 (for example) and I label the post.. but then I am suddenly back to posts 1-5... annoying! I am unable to label posts quickly and efficiently.  

# Images Look and Feel Changed

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J3A8WqpdCX0/TErQK8jcIqI/AAAAAAAAAi8/ccbgeU0IoQY/s1600/Images.gif)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_J3A8WqpdCX0/TErQK8jcIqI/AAAAAAAAAi8/ccbgeU0IoQY/s1600/Images.gif)</div>

And if we are on Google topic, did you notice Google Image Search look and feel changed?  
The page used to show small thumbnails with text below it.  
Now there's no more text and images are bigger. When you hover on one with the mouse it zooms in with a cool effect.  

The biggest change, however, is probably the fact that you don't have Prev and Next pages anymore.  
All the images are on same page, and they load in background as you scroll. Which makes the search faster and nicer.  

I liked it. how about you? (comment below).
