[Bit.Ly](http://bit.ly/)  

Are you using twitter?  
Did you notice those weird links that start with bit.ly? but direct you to some other place? What is that all about? And they are not nice links.. something like http://bit.ly/9URPo6..  

Since tweeter allows only 140 characters in a message, someone thought it would be good to shorten all links. On the way they added a tracking one all links - so you can know how many clicks you had.  
Plus, you can reuse the link.  

The interface is a bit annoying - sometimes, same URL will appear as different links, because they don't recognize their own links, and reshorten them. meaning - http://bit.ly/9URPo6   will become some other bit.ly link, and will be added to tracking log.  

Oh yeah.. you can't delete a link.. :(

[Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/)  

Unlike other "cool" applications, this application has a developers look and feel - meaning only developers should look at it..  

It's easy to set a new tracking, but finding your way around the different sites you're tracking takes time to get used to.  

The hierarchy is : Accounts / Profiles / Reports  

I don't actually know what account and profile differs in, but navigation-wise, if you want to reach from "profiles" to "account" you should search for "overview" link.  

Reports are the hardest to get out from. You need to click "Analytics Settings" - to reach to "profiles". only then can you go to "account/overview".  

Once you got a hold of these things, it's almost a smoot ride. This application doesn't perform as smooth as a google application. It lingers on every click.  
However - the layout of information is quite good, and graphic. In one screen you can know how may visitors you had, when, from where and so on..  

I was amazed to discover that blogger doesn't have a built-in support for analytics.. why should I configure anything? it's all google! it seems no google application supports it by default. and that's a shame.  
While you can easily add it to [blogger by moditfying the template](http://www.andywibbels.com/how-to-add-google-analytics-to-your-blogger-blog/) and ["google sites" by changing configuration](http://www.google.com/support/sites/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=173135), you can't really use it on picasa for example. Youtube for example has a small analytic mechanism, but it's not sufficient.  
I was also amazed to know - Flickr (by yahoo) had outdone google by giving the users great analytics on their photos. oh well..   

And it's always a bummer to discover that you're not imagining - no one visits your sites.
