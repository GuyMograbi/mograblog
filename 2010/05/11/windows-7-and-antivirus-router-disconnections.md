As if straight out of Ripley's believe or not, it seems that an antivirus installed on windows 7 prevents router reconnection. May sound strange, but I believe so.  

I can live with an internet connection that sometimes disconnects. However, I do expect a router to recover from such thing. Since I was home ever since my win7 arrived, I didn't notice it until 2-3 weeks ago (when I started working again) - but the router did not recover from disconnections anymore.  

I have 3 computers. 2 XPs and 1 Win7\. But I experienced the problem only on Win7.  

OK - so what do you do? Well, the solution was to remove my Anti-Virus and install "Microsoft Security Essential". It's been a week now and everything seems to be fine. I detect disconnections, but 1-2 minutes later, the problem is solved. (Which is tolerable).  

UPDATE  

Well several weeks later, and I am glad to say problem is solved!  
I can see disconnections occur still, but at least the system bounces back and reconnects - so my surf is undisturbed.
