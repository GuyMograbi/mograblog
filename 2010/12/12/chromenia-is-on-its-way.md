Google had a developers event for Chrome OS - with the addictive slogan "Nothing but Web". (A copy of the well known commercial slogan '[nothing but net](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oACRt-Qp-s)' mcdonalds commercials)  
View it on the chrome [youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/googlechrome).  

# Steps on Chrome Webstore

I also took the chance to see how hard is it to add an application to the webstore. It takes about 20 minutes for the first application, but afterwards I bet you can get it right in 5\.  
You should have a 128X128 icon, a 400X275 screenshot and verify the site is yours - I recommend using google analytics and then registering the site with [Google's Webmaster](https://www.google.com/webmasters).  

So now you can find [Steps](http://steps.mograbi.co.il/) on the webstore.  

# Highlights From Event

*   Chrome is fast. Really fast.. see the cool video for [Chrome Speed Tests](http://www.youtube.com/user/googlechrome#p/c/6C464642AA716B69/0/nCgQDjiotG0)  
*   Chrome is considered an OS since it runs directly on the hardware  
*   All data is encrypted - encryption is built in, so you don't have to worry about hiding personal data while lending the laptop to friends  
*   Incognito is used for "Guest" users - guests don't need to clean cache before they return the laptop. Cache is deleted once you exit incognito mode  
*   Chrome applications/extensions will be able to run on all browsers  
*   Cool - chrome OS itself is on the cloud. Changes (for example installing a new application) in one instance of chrome, are available anywhere  
*   Automatic updates to everything (OS and applications). No prompts to update.. update happens in the background with bothering you  
*   Citrix support - allows you to use all the applications you used via citrix so far. Really attractive to big organizations that use it  
*   Practically no load overhead. Chrome OS loads instantly  
*   Applications (probably some, not all) will be able to run when you're offline. - For example Google Docs  
*   Connectivity was discussed in the event. Google announced it funds connectivity on major airlines companies, and deals with Verizon connectivity. read more about [Verizon connectivity with Chrome laptops](http://www.mobileburn.com/news.jsp?Id=11981)  

Nothing was said about the price, but reading online I see expectations are for a low price.  
I can even guess a number and say I think the price will be somewhere around 200$ - 400$. While I am quite positive it will be closer to 200$. It may sound ridiculous to you now, but I think that's exactly the effect Google will won't at launch. At 200$ consumers will buy the laptop just out of boredom, giving Google a fair slice of the market.  

Running a Chrome installation on Windows/Mac/Unix machines will give users the same experience as the Chrome OS. Non the less, it will synchronize with the Chrome OS changes as specified above in the list. This is a clever step by Chrome, as the users know exactly what to expect from the new OS experience, and migrate in small steps probably skipping back and forward until they are convinced they need nothing other than Chrome. Google developers report they have been using Chrome OS laptops as their main computer for about half a year now in order to show it is a realistic view.  

It is a custom by now to give away the launched item in developers events. All attendees got a chance to receive the laptop. Google also announced an open registration. So if you think you are a suitable candidate, you can [apply for a Chrome OS laptop](https://services.google.com/fb/forms/cr48advanced/) too.
