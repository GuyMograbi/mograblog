Just got an iPod touch. And I installed some application on it. I am posting this using blogpress as you can see below - the signature is created automatically.  

The first time experience with iPod touch ( which is exactly like iPhone) is hell. On my desktop my windows recognizes the iPod but iTunes does not. Couldn't find caps lock and had to use it. Spent 2 hours figuring out how to transfer ebooks from computer to iTunes/iPod . Not intuitive at all... Expected more. Had to google everything, and for some I didn't find the answer so easily. 6 hours later, and I think I am all set to go.  

On the bright side, the camera is awesome and fast. Really fast, it is amazing. And this blogpress is really fun. I can easily add images to blog now, and everything is automatically published in Facebook and twitter .
