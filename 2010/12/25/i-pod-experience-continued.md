So I found out several things on the iPod I thought I should share.  

A better book reader called stanza. Supports  
multiple sources for books. For example it let's you add "pragmatic bookshelf" as book resource. So you can download books from there directly without using the computer. Makes the whole iTunes sync much easier.  
Another feature stanza has which I was missing from iBooks is the ability to change fonts by pulling fingers closer/away. Seems so intuitive, since this is the mechanism used for safari and photos, it quite struck me when I realized iBooks didn't have that.  

Another thing I discovered is that I am unable to download an app called "whatsapp". It does to SMS what skype does to phone. I don't really get why it is so popular, and why not simply use Facebook chat but that is probably just because i don't have it yet. First of all, it does not appear on searches in AppStore. When I ran the same search from another apple gizmo I did find it. So that means the search is filtered. Which is weird as I got the impression that iPhone should have a better compatibility support. But maybe that's just me.  
When I clock links to download this app - for example when someone shares this app with me - I get a weird popup saying "the request could not be completed". Which is even weirder... I would expect something like "this app does not support...". Or, even better, let me see the app, but don't let me download it. Because the way things look now it seems as if the AppStore has a bug.  

Other than that, I must say the experience is great. Don't waste any time and by this device. Connectivity to iTunes and AppStore enriched my life in so many ways. There's good material here, not just junk. Science lectures, educational games, informative and free podcasts and some really good reading.
