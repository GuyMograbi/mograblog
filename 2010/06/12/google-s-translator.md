Wow! Did you see that?  

Youtube has subtitles now, and it's in all languages(!).. cool, isn't it?  

<object height="364" width="445"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/siOHh0uzcuY&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0xcc2550&amp;color2=0xe87a9f&amp;border=1"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/siOHh0uzcuY&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0xcc2550&amp;color2=0xe87a9f&amp;border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="445" height="364"></object>  

It probably works with Voice Recognition, and Google Translator to achieve these features..  

You can change the language with the controller below, to get the subtitles in your native language.  

It's far from perfect, especially when dealing with technical words and acronyms, which is totally understandable. It rocks. It really does.  

There are many projects that should supply translations to you, such as in [Mozilla's Lab](http://mozillalabs.com/conceptseries/2010/03/11/announcing-the-collaborative-video-subtitling-design-challenge/). However, while some just start talking about it, Google is already there!  

Simply by taking 2 technologies it probably already has : voice recognition and [translation](http://translate.google.com/#) you get yet another powerful boost from Google to the web.

# Keeping ahead

It seems the world simply can't keep up with Google's pace. And the translation feature simply proves it yet again.  

It seems to me that if someone wants a breakthrough, they should support not a translation, but rather dubbing the videos. We are still far away from automating that process, so manual work is still required in this section, **if such a feature is required at all**.  

# Goodbye Babylon

[![](http://i42.tinypic.com/1222p7n.jpg)](http://i42.tinypic.com/1222p7n.jpg)  
It so often happens that a company survives on a mere small niche that is so desperately needed in the world.  
Such a case is the translation need. Over the years Babylon became more than that - allowing search on Wikipedia and defining your own dictionaries (which I found very helpful to keep a phonebook in).  

How far are we to say goodbye to such applications? Babylon seems to me to be the strongest one, so we will probably see it first at some smaller initiatives.  

Just think of the potential Google has right now!  

For example : about 4 months ago I bought Windows 7, and accidentally got it in my native language and not English. It was hell to switch it back - time consuming and full of bureaucracy. Now think about OS by Google, and how hard should it be to translate it?  
Not only it should be painless, but it can dynamically translate everything to your needs.  

*   Files you just downloaded will automatically have a translated file name
*   content of such files can be automatically translated
*   String of applications running in that OS can be automatically translated (goodbye I18N support! Yey)
*   SMS over Google phones can be auto translated

We are soon to experience that translation power on [Google Wave with Rosy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvQhxWK9-KY) and to tell you the truth, I see no limit to Google's translation power. Adding to that - no competitors on the market at all! Wake up giants.  

# The final frontier

How far can this go? really.  
Will we one day have a single language on the keyboard?  
Will we be able to talk Hebrew on the phone, and it will be English on the other end? (Something like in Start-Trek world?)  
Will we be able to take lectures in Hebrew from Harvard?  

Will we be able to finally talk to dolphins, and will dogs be able to search Google easily? :) (Just Kidding).

# What does this mean for developers?

Developers today need to program the support for translations. We have mechanisms in frameworks and so on, but eventually, we need to supply the translation, and layout new layouts.  

How much of this will be redundant with Google Translation Advanced? Potentially, everything. Your site today can already be translated automatically without any effort. What about non web applications? We might be seeing a breakthrough in this in a much nearer future than we imagined so far - who imagined that by 2009-2010 Google will be able to auto caption and translate movies? I didn't.  

Remains to be seen.  
Thank you Google yet again.
